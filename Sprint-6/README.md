1. First you need to have xcode download.
2. Pleasea download the zip file and open the Travel_Place.xcworkspace
after open it pleasea click play button on the left up corner. 
3. I create a ios app with the google sign in. The firt thing of the app is login in with your Google account.
After login you can add travel note and picture in it. And it will save locally. 
4. This app have a bug that when you write the notes, it have the name and the description, but when you save, it show name on both name and description. I hope I can fix it in my final application.
