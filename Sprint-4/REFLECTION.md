* I have look many of them, such as sails, hydra, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.
 
* I choose to use Sails because Sails is the one really easy to understand. Is very friendly to everyone, even a begineer. People Just need to to follow their steps and can be set up.

* I have use the Sails to set up and start with new app. Is really easy for user to set up their own application and work on it.

* I do not have obstacles after I really know what should I do for this assignment. The Sails is really easy for people to work with. Also, after watch the example Dr. Goggins do, I find the way of how to work for the SSO.
