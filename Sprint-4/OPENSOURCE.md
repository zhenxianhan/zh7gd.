After reading the Article, I find out the motivtion for people to contribute at open source is different, is can be exterinsic motovation like money or career opportunities. It also can be intrinsic motivations like Altruism, which contributors enjoy for halping other people and the community. There are many motivations for prople jion open source, but they all contributr a lot for the growing of open source. When I read the article, I frist look at the vote of motivation. Most people are contribute to open source because is fun, can learn some news stuff, and Altruism. This is really good to know especially right now most people are paid for doing open source project.
