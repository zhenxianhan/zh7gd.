1. First, you have to download the xcode for running the application.
2. Second, please download the Travel_Place zip file in this folder.
3. Open the Travel_Place.xcworkspace in xcode, and click the play button on the up left corner. 
4. This app is an app about travel notes. It is use the Google sign in to login. After login, user can write Travel notes and add a picture of it.
5. There are something that I didn't finish is I didn't have a log out button after sign in. I plan to add this in the future. 
6. Also, there is a bug in the app. After user write and save the new travel notes, they cannot see the change immediately. the user have to click the play button again to see the new travel notes they create. I don't know why is this happen, and I didn't find the way to fix it.
